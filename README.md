### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the labs were very helpful in preparing for the project. Learning about fetching data from an api and modifying the api URL for different queries, manipulating HTML string with innerHTML and getting HTML using the query selector were in fact helpful for this project. I do not feel unprepared to complete the stretch features, I just more time and most likely more practice with the concepts we learned during the week.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
If I had more, I would have worked on the votes stars, as of now, I only have emoji embedded, and I would have given users option to see the actual stars that match the vote average
  

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

All the features I have went well, I think what did not go as planned is the load More button at the bottom that is not getting centered as I wanted so I just centered the text and made the background color inexistant. I noticed that some of my peers spend a good of time making their website more asthetic, even though mine is not that bad in terms of asthetic, I could always add more CSS.
